  "task_prompt_peg_validate_feature_tools": "Your task is to check for **logical contradictions or thematic clashes** between a creative instruction and the data generated from it. You are NOT checking for an exact 1:1 match.\n\n**CRITICAL RULE:** The Level Generator is EXPECTED to creatively add details like dimensions, materials, and specific descriptions. You should only flag these properties if they **directly contradict** the spirit of the original sentence, or if the provided **REASON** is illogical.\n\n### Creative Instruction (Sentence):\n{sentence}\n\n### Generated Data and Creative Rationale:\n{formatted_feature_data}\n\n### Instructions:\nFirst, provide a brief justification for your decisions in a single block of prose under the `justification_prose` key. Then, for each property below, output the property name followed by `TRUE` if it is inconsistent, or `FALSE` if it is a reasonable creative interpretation.\n\n### Properties to Review:\n- `change_name`: Does the name **clash** with the sentence's theme (e.g., calling a dark crypt 'The Sun Room')?\n- `change_description`: Does the description **miss the main point** of the sentence?\n- `change_type`: Is the abstract type **logically wrong** for what is described (e.g., calling a bridge a `CONTAINER`)?\n- `change_dimensions`: Do the dimensions **directly contradict** the sentence (e.g., making a 'tiny crawlspace' 100ft wide)?\n\n### EXAMPLE of a GOOD Correction:\n- **Sentence:** \"A tiny, cramped crawlspace.\"\n- **Data:** `- dimensions_tiles: (20, 20) (REASON: Crawlspaces are usually big.)`\n- **Your Justification:** The reason is illogical and the dimensions contradict the sentence.\n- **Your Flag:** `change_dimensions: TRUE`\n\n### EXAMPLE of a BAD Correction (DO NOT DO THIS):\n- **Sentence:** \"A cavernous chamber.\"\n- **Data:** `- dimensions_tiles: (8, 4) (REASON: This seems like a good medium size for a cavern.)`\n- **Your Justification:** The sentence doesn't mention specific dimensions.\n- **Your Flag:** `change_dimensions: TRUE` -- THIS IS WRONG. The dimensions and reason are a reasonable creative addition.\n\n### Your Response:",
  "task_prompt_prometheus_tool_use": "Your task is to analyze recent events in the roleplay and determine which specialized tools are necessary to process what has happened. You do not perform the actions yourself; you only decide which tools are needed.\n\n### Active Characters:\n{character_list}\n\n### Recent Events:\n{recent_events}\n\n### Instructions:\nFor each tool in the list below, first reason about each tool (1-2 sentences) and then decide whether it should be used. After providing justifications for all tools, you MUST output each tool's keyword followed by either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.\n\n### Available Tools:\n- `is_refusal`: Set to TRUE if the text is a simple refusal to respond or continue the game/roleplay. You don't need to list other tools or reason about them if this is true.\n-`is_role_break`: Set to TRUE if the text steps out of character or disrupts a narrative or roleplay scenario, such as repeating its instructions, finishing the story like it's a book, writing a 'cliffhanger' to conclude, thanking the reader politely for the 'story', or other indications it's 'lost the plot' and is behaving like a stereotypical AI chatbot. Like is_refusal, if this is true, you may output is_role_break: TRUE and stop.\n- `summarize_for_memory`: Should be used if the recent events contain significant new information, actions, or character development that should be permanently remembered.\n- `remove_character`: Set to true if a character has died, permanently left the scene, or is otherwise gone from the story.\n- `new_character`: Set to true if the text describes or names a new character who is not on the provided list of active characters.\n- `select_next_actor`: Set to true ONLY if the recent events contain a clear and direct narrative hand-off, such as one character speaking to or waiting for another specific character.\n- 'modify_equipment': Set to true if a character has added or removed objects or apparel.\n\n### EXAMPLE RESPONSE FORMAT:\nReasoning: The events are not a refusal to respond or continue the conversation, no to is_refusal. The events appear to be part of a story, but they end with 'and she couldn't help but wonder what other wonders and dangers lay ahead.' which is a corny cliffhanger/stinger that wraps up the story, so is_role_break should be true. I can stop here.\n\nis_refusal: FALSE\nis_role_break: TRUE\n\n### EXAMPLE 2:\nReasoning: The events are not a refusal to respond or continue the conversation, so is_refusal should be false. The events appear to be part of a roleplay between two of the four characters listed, and none of them appear to be breaking character - is_role_break should be false. The events are very memorable, with one of the characters confessing their role in a crime. summarize_for_memory should be TRUE.\nNone of the characters die or leave the story, so remove_character is false. No one new is mentioned in the events I am seeing compared to the character list, so new_character is false. The persons speaking at the end addresses another character 'Rosa,' who has not responded yet, so select_next_actor is true. Thaddeus slips off his shirt because it's too warm, and drops his keys on the table, so modify_equipment might be true.\nLet's go through the list:\n\nis_refusal: FALSE\nis_role_break: FALSE\nsummarize_for_memory: TRUE\nremove_character: FALSE\nnew_character: FALSE\nselect_next_actor: TRUE\nmodify_equipment: TRUE\nWe are done.\n### END EXAMPLES"
